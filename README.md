# Introduction

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/acerv/MCP2210-Sharp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/acerv/MCP2210-Sharp)

This is a C# (.NET 3.5) library that is built to interface with the Microchip 
MCP2210 USB to SPI device.

## License
The library is using the MIT License and it's open for commercial usage. 

## Dependences
The only dependency is HidSharp, a multi-platform library that supports 
Windows, MacOS, and Linux (hidraw). You can find it 
[here](http://www.zer7.com/software/hidsharp).
The reason why I used this library, is related to its simplicity, documentation 
and stability. And, of course, the ISC license, that is compatible with the 
MIT one.

## General view
The library supports all the features of the MCP2210, which are explained in 
the datasheet. 
The main interface is given by the `IUsbToSpiDevice`, that contains the modules 
used to interface with various parts of the device.
The modules are the following:

 * `INonVoltatileRam`: the non-volatile RAM module
 * `IVolatileRam`: the volatile RAM module
 * `IExternalInterruptPin`: the external interrupt pin module
 * `ISpiDataTransfer`: the SPI data transfer module
 * `IEepromMemory`: the EEPROM module
 
## Help & Debug
If you need any help, don't exitate to ask me any question.

## Documentation
The library is documented and there's not the wiki page yet.
